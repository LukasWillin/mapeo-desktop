- electron-gh-releases sounds promising
  - fully static (no servers we need to run)
  - uses the github repo itself
  - just need to maintain a single json file (we can make a post-version npm hook)
- osx *demands* code signing for auto-update to work
  - what's done:
    - I've got the .p12 as a base64'd env var on the travis environment
    - the logic to decode that .p12 and load it into the osx keyring works
  - not done:
    - I haven't figured out the cert/key dance yet so we can use travis to sign
    - which identity do I use? it claims "no identities found"!
- haven't done any windows tests yet, but I don't think code signing is needed
